# Pokémon Challenge

In this project, a mobile application was created to retrieve the details and abilities of Pokémon. This project consists of two screens; on the first screen, you can see a complete list of Pokémon, and there is also an option to search for a specific Pokémon by name. Upon selecting a Pokémon, you will be directed to the second screen, which displays detailed information about each Pokémon. All the information is being extracted directly from the pokeapi API.
